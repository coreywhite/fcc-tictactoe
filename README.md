Free Code Camp - Advanced Front End Project - Tic Tac Toe

Made for Free Code Camp.

## Requirements

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/KzXQgy/.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## Notes

This game features multiple AI difficulty levels, including an unbeatable implementation of the Minimax algorithm as a "Hard" difficulty. It is also possible to play two computer opponents against each other.
